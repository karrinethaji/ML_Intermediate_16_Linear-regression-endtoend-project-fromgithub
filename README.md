# Linear-regression-end-to-end-ML-project
End to end project on linear regression algorithm 
1. Performing EDA and feature engineering on algerian dataset
2. Let's use ridge,lasso and elastic net regression to train our model and Create the pickel file for the model which providing good accuracy and standardscaler object to preprocess the data
3. Create the web app using the flask
4. Deploy the machine learning model in AWS cloud environment
